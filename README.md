# Rose

Rose is a "Relationship Evaluation Algorithm". It's not a dating app, or anything like that. It simply evaluates a current or potential relationship.

# How it Works
You start out with a set of questions that relate to a relationship i.e. *Are they tall*, *Do they treat you well*, *Do you like them*, etc. There's a set of boilerplate questions if you don't want to make your own from scratch. You can also add questions as you please.
First you go through all the questions and ask yourself, "how important is it to me that ________" (*they are tall*, *they treat you well*, *you like them*). That creates a preferences file which you can save and reuse as you like. You only have to do this once, but as you learn more, you might go through and change your preferences. You can also specify certain things as "dealbreakers", but be careful of having too many.
Then, you go through all the questions again with a specific person in mind, i.e. *is John tall*, *does John treat me well*, *do I like John*, etc. This gives you an evaluation file, which you can save for funsies.
Finally, you need to specify a "*pickiness*" value. This is just a number between 0 and 1 that says how desperate you are.
The program then essentially takes a weighted average (how important the quality is to you * how much the specific person fulfills the quality) of all the questions, and if it's greater than your pickiness value, then you should enter a relationship with them, if not, don't. Or, alternately, whether you should end the relationship with them or not.

# **PLEASE NOTE**
This is solely a method of objectively quantifying your feelings based on previous standards you yourself set. It is not the end-all be-all of deciding the enter or end a relationship with someone. It is simply a way to know how you yourself objectively are feeling, when it's difficult to be objective. That's why it's called Rose, it's meant to help you take off the rose-colored glasses and see things objectively. And to help you not change your standards when preseted with something new you think you like. However, it's only as good as the standards you set. I recommend calibrating the prefrences file **before** you are considering entering or exiting a relationship, so it will be more objective.
